###Description of app

I essentially want this app to be a blog for rock climbers. Since climbers usually go to adventurous areas, I thought to make an app that lets a person document their trip about where they went and what they climbed. They will be able to upload pictures along with their post to add some imagery to their trips. Along with documenting their own trips, people will be able to view another person's blog to look at their adventures and in a later update, favorite them. And if they like that person's content a lot, one can follow another person to get updates on their dashboard so that they won't miss any of their posts.

Further down the line, I would want people to be able to schedule event meetups. Climbers usually need someone to spot them so this could be a useful feature. Messaging would also be added later along with tagged words and searching. If people could tag words on their post, then later one another person would be able to filter out what they want to view decided by location, types of climbs or difficulty of the climb.

  
###Technologies Used

- HTML 
- CSS
- JQuery
- Ruby on Rails

###Getting Started
**Link to Blog:** https://climbon-blog.herokuapp.com/  

When you first go to the website you are greeted with a login page. From there you can sign up using the link in the navbar. After completing the sign up sheet you can basically roam around the blog looking at random users through an explore button in the navbar. Feel free to write a post from the dashboard or from your profile page and watch it pop up in your dashboard.

If you'd like to follow someone, go to their page and click the follow button under their user information. This will add their posts to your dashboard as well for you to view. If you click on their post, you'll also be able to leave comments as well to talk about that person's trip.




###Unsolved Problems

The random user button seems to glitch after one clicks it. It is also able to display the current user's profile page which is something I'd like to get rid of in the future. There is a lot of styling I'd like to implement better in the future. I also tried to have users be able to upload their own background images on their profiles but didn't have time to complete it.
